# Old Discord UI
basically, this is a somewhat representation of the old discord UI.

This CSS was not made by me, rather it was a bunch of [vencord](https://vencord.dev) CSS snippets combined together.

If you would like to use this, do the following:

## 1. - Download Vencord
To download Vencord: Visit the [Vencord Website](https://vencord.dev) and install it. Once installed, you have to patch it and restart Discord.

## 2. - Add It to your Discord QuickCSS
First, open Settings. After settings is opened, scroll down the sidebar until you see the **Vencord** category. Then, click the Vencord button and under the **Quick Actions Section**, press **Edit QuickCSS**. You will see a new Window open. In that window, paste the following:

```
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/absrtc/old-discord-ui/refs/heads/master/ui.css");
```
